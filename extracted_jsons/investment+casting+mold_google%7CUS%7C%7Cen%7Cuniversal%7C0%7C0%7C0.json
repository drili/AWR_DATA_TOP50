Once the ceramic coating material is dry and hardened, the wax is melted out and leaves an internal cavity the shape of the final product's geometry. Molten metal is poured into the cavity where the wax pattern was. The metal solidifies within the ceramic cavity, cools, and the ceramic is removed from the metal casting. The result of this process is a net to near-net precision metal component which can be used for a broad range of applications in various industries.","page":1,"position":8,"title":"Investment Casting Process - Aero Metals","type":"0","typedescription":"organic","url":"https://www.aerometals.com/metal-casting-101/casting-process","universal_position":5,"md5":"5b9088309792274d441cacb1d8f7b932"},{"elementAttributes":"{\"class\":\"g Ww4FFb vt6azd tF2Cxc\",\"data-hveid\":\"COMBEAA\",\"data-ved\":\"2ahUKEwidrrDuxqr6AhUqGFkFHUB2AdIQFSgAegUI4wEQAA\",\"jsaction\":\"QyLbLe:OMITjf\",\"jscontroller\":\"SC7lYd\",\"lang\":\"en\",\"style\":\"width:600px\"}","description":"In investment casting, a wax pattern is coated with a refractory material to make a mould, which is then melted away before pouring molten metal into the ...","page":1,"position":9,"title":"What is Investment Casting - Engineering Product Design","type":"0","typedescription":"organic","url":"https://engineeringproductdesign.com/knowledge-base/investment-casting/","universal_position":6,"md5":"d58c55a09e471457b1b2ae64f3e1cffd"},{"snippets":{"faqs":"How are investment castings made?; What is an investment casting?"},"elementAttributes":"{\"class\":\"g Ww4FFb vt6azd tF2Cxc\",\"data-hveid\":\"CLEBEAA\",\"data-ved\":\"2ahUKEwidrrDuxqr6AhUqGFkFHUB2AdIQFSgAegUIsQEQAA\",\"jsaction\":\"QyLbLe:OMITjf\",\"jscontroller\":\"SC7lYd\",\"lang\":\"en\",\"style\":\"width:600px\"}","description":"Developing investment castings involves creating an original wax pattern, coating the image with plaster and building of successive layers until a strong shell envelopes the model.
