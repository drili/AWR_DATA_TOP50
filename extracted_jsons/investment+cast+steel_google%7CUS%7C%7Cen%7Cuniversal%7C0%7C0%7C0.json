Once the ceramic coating material is dry and hardened, the wax is melted out and leaves an internal cavity the shape of the final product's geometry. Molten metal is poured into the cavity where the wax pattern was. The metal solidifies within the ceramic cavity, cools, and the ceramic is removed from the metal casting. The result of this process is a net to near-net precision metal component which can be used for a broad range of applications in various industries.","page":1,"position":11,"title":"Investment Casting Process - Aero Metals","type":"0","typedescription":"organic","url":"https://www.aerometals.com/metal-casting-101/casting-process","universal_position":6,"md5":"c8ee4b55b15448288d98d7decae06b70"},{"elementAttributes":"{\"class\":\"g Ww4FFb vt6azd tF2Cxc\",\"data-hveid\":\"CLwBEAA\",\"data-ved\":\"2ahUKEwjizOHuxqr6AhValYkEHRgjC9YQFSgAegUIvAEQAA\",\"jsaction\":\"QyLbLe:OMITjf\",\"jscontroller\":\"SC7lYd\",\"lang\":\"en\",\"style\":\"width:600px\"}","description":"Lost Wax Investment Casting in Mexico.","page":1,"position":12,"title":"Engineered Metal Products - Mexico - USA","type":"0","typedescription":"organic","url":"http://investment-cast.com/","universal_position":7,"md5":"f5ae1aa5a71c26edcf668b7e959dbedc"},{"elementAttributes":"{\"class\":\"g Ww4FFb vt6azd tF2Cxc\",\"data-hveid\":\"CKABEAA\",\"data-ved\":\"2ahUKEwjizOHuxqr6AhValYkEHRgjC9YQFSgAegUIoAEQAA\",\"jsaction\":\"QyLbLe:OMITjf\",\"jscontroller\":\"SC7lYd\",\"lang\":\"en\",\"style\":\"width:600px\"}","description":"This is an investment casting foundry where scorching molten metal is poured into molds and turned into high-strength aluminum and steel ...","page":1,"position":13,"title":"What is Investment Casting? - Barron Industries","type":"0","typedescription":"organic","url":"https://www.barron-industries.com/what-is-investment-casting/","universal_position":8,"md5":"0d6cc31c99cb286d13c45bbe5023bab6"},{"elementAttributes":"{\"class\":\"g Ww4FFb vt6azd tF2Cxc\",\"data-hveid\":\"CMcBEAA\",\"data-ved\":\"2ahUKEwjizOHuxqr6AhValYkEHRgjC9YQFSgAegUIxwEQAA\",\"jsaction\":\"QyLbLe:OMITjf\",\"jscontroller\":\"SC7lYd\",\"lang\":\"en\",\"style\":\"width:600px\"}","description":"In investment casting, a wax pattern is coated with a refractory material to make a mould, which is then melted away before pouring molten metal into the ...","page":1,"position":14,"title":"What is Investment Casting - Engineering Product Design","type":"0","typedescription":"organic","url":"https://engineeringproductdesign.com/knowledge-base/investment-casting/","universal_position":9,"md5":"f117725d8f2c5aea83e6a0cf6e8bbc58"},{"elementAttributes":"{\"class\":\"g Ww4FFb vt6azd tF2Cxc\",\"data-hveid\":\"CNgBEAA\",\"data-ved\":\"2ahUKEwjizOHuxqr6AhValYkEHRgjC9YQFSgAegUI2AEQAA\",\"jsaction\":\"QyLbLe:OMITjf\",\"jscontroller\":\"SC7lYd\",\"lang\":\"en\",\"style\":\"width:600px\"}","description":"Investment casting, sometimes precision investment casting or lost wax casting, is a manufacturing method used with metals.
