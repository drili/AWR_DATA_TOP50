Molten metal is poured into the cavity where the wax pattern was. The metal solidifies within the ceramic cavity, cools, and the ceramic is removed from the metal casting.

Once the ceramic coating material is dry and hardened, the wax is melted out and leaves an internal cavity the shape of the final product's geometry. Molten metal is poured into the cavity where the wax pattern was. The metal solidifies within the ceramic cavity, cools, and the ceramic is removed from the metal casting. The result of this process is a net to near-net precision metal component which can be used for a broad range of applications in various industries.","page":1,"position":9,"title":"Investment Casting Process - Aero Metals","type":"0","typedescription":"organic","url":"https://www.aerometals.com/metal-casting-101/casting-process","universal_position":6,"md5":"e434d321874af1831ee57020920c46f1"},{"snippets":{"indented":"yes"},"elementAttributes":"{\"class\":\"MYVUIe\"}","description":"The metal investment casting process is very versatile and produces a wide range of metal cast assemblies for a range of industries.
