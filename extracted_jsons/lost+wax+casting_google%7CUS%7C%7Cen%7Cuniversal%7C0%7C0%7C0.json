Follow our lost wax casting process steps below to find out how (using a silver ring as an example): Using a wax tube, cut out the shape of a standard ring. Then, outline the pattern on the ring with a scribe, to provide a guidance on where the first cuts are going to be. Next, file the wax to the shape you require using a special carving file. Top tip: remember that you can file the wax down quite thin as silver weighs 11 times more than wax. Once the wax has been filed to your requirements, it's time to attach a wax sprue to the ring. To do so, hold the sprue over a low flame until it starts to drip and then quickly place it on the ring in the heaviest area. Weigh the ring and make a note of how much it weighs. In order to calculate the amount of silver you need, consult these equations: for silver \u2013 calculate the weight of the wax multiplied by 11 and plus 10g to accommodate for the weight of the sprue.

Follow our lost wax casting process steps below to find out how (using a silver ring as an example): Using a wax tube, cut out the shape of a standard ring. Then, outline the pattern on the ring with a scribe, to provide a guidance on where the first cuts are going to be. Next, file the wax to the shape you require using a special carving file. Top tip: remember that you can file the wax down quite thin as silver weighs 11 times more than wax. Once the wax has been filed to your requirements, it's time to attach a wax sprue to the ring. To do so, hold the sprue over a low flame until it starts to drip and then quickly place it on the ring in the heaviest area. Weigh the ring and make a note of how much it weighs. In order to calculate the amount of silver you need, consult these equations: for silver \u2013 calculate the weight of the wax multiplied by 11 and plus 10g to accommodate for the weight of the sprue.

Top tip: remember that you can file the wax down quite thin as silver weighs 11 times more than wax. Once the wax has been filed to your requirements, it's time to attach a wax sprue to the ring. To do so, hold the sprue over a low flame until it starts to drip and then quickly place it on the ring in the heaviest area. Weigh the ring and make a note of how much it weighs.

Follow our lost wax casting process steps below to find out how (using a silver ring as an example): Using a wax tube, cut out the shape of a standard ring. Then, outline the pattern on the ring with a scribe, to provide a guidance on where the first cuts are going to be. Next, file the wax to the shape you require using a special carving file. Top tip: remember that you can file the wax down quite thin as silver weighs 11 times more than wax. Once the wax has been filed to your requirements, it's time to attach a wax sprue to the ring. To do so, hold the sprue over a low flame until it starts to drip and then quickly place it on the ring in the heaviest area. Weigh the ring and make a note of how much it weighs. In order to calculate the amount of silver you need, consult these equations: for silver \u2013 calculate the weight of the wax multiplied by 11 and plus 10g to accommodate for the weight of the sprue.
