Ideal for rapid prototyping, the digital process means that design alterations can be done quickly and efficiently during the manufacturing process. The lack of material wastage provides cost reduction for high value parts, while AM has also been shown to reduce lead times.In addition, parts that previously required assembly from multiple pieces can be fabricated as a single object which can provide improved strength and durability.
